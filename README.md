# Water Balloon Fight Simulator  
This is a project I worked on while studying Data Structures and algorithms at Eastern Oregon University my Computer Science degree.  
Its written purely in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  
  
Some of the features I had fun creating are random map generation using the A* path finding algorithm to detect if the map generated is able to be fully walked even if it is only one square.  
The NPCs use the A* to find the random destination they wish to go to and then attack one another.  
I used a heap to determine which sprite should be drawn first so that when they are drawn on the screen there is a correct overlapping of depth between sprites who are father away.  
  
Overall its a fun project that let me practice some of what I learned in my Algorithm Analysis Class CS_318.
